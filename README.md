# Playlist Program C++
This repository contains an Xcode project and its files for the Playlist Program C++, a program that creates a playlist and includes several customization operations to organize and customize to the userâ€™s liking through the usage of data structures

Traversing through a linked list, the program accomplishes is capable of performing the following tasks:<br/>

Option (a): Adding a song<br/>
Option (d): Removing a song<br/>

Option (o): Output full playlist<br/>
Option (q): Quit<br/>

## Playlist.h
The PlaylistNode class and Playlist class are contained in this file. Playlist.h contains all of the project's function declarations

The following functions are needed for the project to function accordingly:

### For the PlaylistNode class...
    PlaylistNode()
    PlaylistNode(string, string, string, int)
    void InsertAfter(PlaylistNode*)
    void SetNext(PlaylistNode*)
    string GetID()
    string GetSongName()
    string GetArtistName()
    int GetSongLength()
    PlaylistNode* GetNext()
    void PrintPlaylistNode()

    void AddSong(string, string , string, int)
    void RemoveSong(string )
    bool ChangePosition(int, int)

    void PrintList()
    bool isEmpty()
    int size()
